    <p>I think it is important to share knowledge and experience with others because I believe that we can accomplish big things when we work together and are supportive of each others learning. This, I hope, demonstrates the impetus behind the development of my personal website. The purpose, at this point, is to give readers an insight into my personal experiences, and how I am progressing in my fields of interest. Hopefully by sharing what I know, you might learn something as well. </p>
<p>To give you some information on my background; in 2010 I graduated with a Bachelors in Anthropology. After that, I wanted more business knowledge and experience. So I went for a Masters in Business Administration. Now, I am pursuing a career in Business Analytics/Business Intelligence. I think it's easy to see a connection between Anthropology and  Business Analytics in hindsight, but it wasn't so clear at the time. In order to find my nich in the business world, I was faced with the challenge of understanding what initially drew me to Anthropology. After much introspection, I discovered that what drew me to Anthropology was my curiosity for the current state of the world, and my desire to make sense of it all. This idea is directly applicable to analytics because data scientists are doing the same thing that I wanted out of Anthropology, but instead of experimenting in the field and writing up an ethnography, data scientists are using technology to tell stories. Anthropologists are data scientists in their own right in the sense that they also have the ability to take data, process it, extract value from it, and communicate it. I realized that the work is the similar, only the context is different, which is why I have taken such a liking to Business Analytics. It provides me with the opportunity to follow my passion in a challenging atmosphere.</p>
<p>One of my favorite quotes from Albert Einstein says; “It is every man's obligation to put back into the world at least the equivalent of what he takes out of it.” In today's world, with so much given to us freely, it would be a shame to not constantly challenge ourselves to bigger and bigger things. This is the highest career aspiration I could hope to achieve. By pursuing a career in Business Analytics, my ultimate aim is to one day have the capability to develop my own tools for doing data analysis. In the meantime, I want to share my journey of learning with you.  </p>
